# Running the App

- Use an Active LTS release since it's recommended for production.

  - See https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

- Install Sass from https://github.com/sass/dart-sass
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build-prod` to build the app once for deployment
- Run `npm run dev` to build the app automatically and run a dev server

Assets should now be served from [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).

Access the site by opening `dev.html` in your browser.

# Upgrading Node

- Run `nvm install $version`, where `$version` is a newer Active LTS release
- Run `nvm use $version` to switch to the newly-installed version
- Update `.nvmrc` with `$version`

## Configuring VSCode

Make sure to have the `ESLint` and `Prettier` plugins installed. If `formatOnSave` is enabled, but `Prettier` isn't doing anything, try setting `Default Formatter` to `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
